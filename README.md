# geophy_test
This is a tutorial (followed along) on geophysics tools demonstration.   

# Case study 
The case study used for this tutorial follows the 2024 Hualien Earthquake Analysis that struck eastern Taiwan with a moment magnitude of 7.4. In this tutorial, seismic data is retrieved and processed using data from USGS's Library of Congress Catalog (libcomcat). 

# Purpose 
Utilising the ObsPy package, we calculate the distance between the epicenter and seismic station (TATO), the earthquake arrival times, the azimuth and backazimuth. Snuffler (from Pyrocko) is used to explore the waveforms retrieved from global stations interactively.
